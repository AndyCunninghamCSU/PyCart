# PyCart: A Python-Based Shopping Cart Application

## Project Overview  
**PyCart** is a Python-based shopping cart application that showcases my ability to design, develop, and implement software solutions using object-oriented programming principles. This project includes both a **terminal-based** and a **GUI-based** interface, demonstrating my versatility in Python development.

## Usage
### To view GUI, which was added as a seperate exercise after course conclusion:
- Ensure tkinter is installed
```bash
py Main_GUI.py
```

### To view terminal interface to satisfy course requirements:
```bash
py Main_Terminal.py
```

## Core Components  

### **Object-Oriented Cart System**  
- **`ItemToPurchase.py`** – Defines individual shopping cart items with attributes such as name, price, quantity, and description.  
- **`ShoppingCart.py`** – Implements a robust shopping cart system, supporting item addition, modification, quantity updates, and cost calculations.  

### **User Interfaces**  
- **`Main_Terminal.py`** – A command-line interface (CLI) for managing the shopping cart, reinforcing my experience with text-based applications.  
- **`Main_GUI.py`** – A Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed for an interactive shopping experience.

## Skills Demonstrated  

**Python Programming** – Mastery of Python fundamentals, including classes, methods, and error handling.  
**Object-Oriented Design** – Encapsulation of shopping cart logic within modular, reusable classes.  
**GUI Development** – Hands-on experience building a responsive UI using **Tkinter**, a native Python GUI toolkit.  
**Software Engineering Best Practices** – Thoughtful structuring of code, clear documentation, and maintainability.  
**AI-Assisted Development** – Utilizing AI as a **mentor, advisor, and reviewer**, ensuring that every line of code is fully understood before implementation.

## AI Disclosure & Development Philosophy  
I believe that **AI, including ChatGPT, is a force multiplier** for informed development. In the context of learning, I adhere to the following principles:  

- All **core shopping cart logic** is **hand-written by me**. AI only served as a tutor for programming concepts and best
practices.
- The **GUI development** leveraged **heavy AI assistance**, focusing on **efficiency** while still ensuring **full comprehension** of the best practices applied.  
- **Main_GUI.py was built in a single evening**, showcasing rapid prototyping and problem-solving abilities.  
- This README was initially drafted by me and **beautified using ChatGPT** for clarity and presentation.
